This repo contains all the algorithms explained in the book Introduction to Machine Learning with python 
by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a beginner and new to ML.
I hope you learnt something new today. Cheers!
This repo also contains a small NLP project using BAG OF WORDS concept.
